# Pizza Bill Generator System - Java Project

The **Pizza Bill Generator System** is a simple object-oriented programming (OOP) project created using Java. Its main purpose is to serve as a tool for practicing and showcasing the understanding of the Java programming language. The project primarily operates through the terminal for input and output interactions; however, there are plans to develop a React website for hosting the frontend part in the future.

## Introduction

The **Pizza Bill Generator System** simulates a restaurant scenario where two types of pizzas are offered: normal pizza and deluxe pizza. The system calculates the cost of each type of pizza based on user preferences and additional selections like extra toppings, cheese, and packaging charges.

## Features

1. Calculate Cost of Normal Pizza:
    - Vegetarian: 300 Ksh
    - Non-Vegetarian: 350 Ksh
    - Additional Extra Toppings: 100 Ksh each
    - Additional Cheese: 100 Ksh

2. Calculate Cost of Deluxe Pizza:
    - Vegetarian: 400 Ksh
    - Non-Vegetarian: 450 Ksh
    - Extra Cheese and Toppings included

3. Takeaway Charges:
    - Packaging: 50 Ksh

## Usage

To use the **Pizza Bill Generator System**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pizza-bill-generator.git
```
2Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pizza-bill-generator
```
3Compile and run the Java program:
```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal to select pizza type, preferences, and packaging choice.

## Class Structure

The project consists of the following main classes:

1. `Pizza`:
- Properties: pizzaType, isVegetarian, basePrice, extraToppings, extraCheese
- Methods: calculateCost()
- etc

2. `NormalPizza` (extends `Pizza`):
- Methods: addToppings(), addCheese()

3. `DeluxePizza` (extends `Pizza`):
- Constructor: automatically includes extra cheese and toppings

4. `Takeaway`:
- Methods: applyPackagingCharge()

5. `Main`:
- Contains the main method to interact with the user and process pizza orders.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the **Pizza Bill Generator System** is a terminal-based application, there are plans to expand its capabilities by creating a React website for the frontend. This would involve developing a user-friendly interface to interact with the pizza ordering system.
